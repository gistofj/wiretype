# Wire Type
## The language agnostic structured data serialization protocol

Wire Type provides a simple, language neutral method of defining structured data serialization protocols. A common intermediate definition language, or IDL, document is created and used to produce language specific implementations of the de/serialization logic required to read and/or write the structured data.
